    <h2>The Illuminati
  </center>
  

  



    <p>The Illuminati is a mysterious secret society group with claims to possess special enlightenment. Their signature hand signal is a triangle/pyramid which is similar to the Eye Of Providence on the $1 bill , The Illuminati was created in Bavaria, Germany by a professor of civil law called Adam Weishaupt in 1778, Adam targeted the wealthy and influential people who had Social influence. The Illuminati's operations were first widely exposed to the public in the 1797 book <i> of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons</i>.

        On May 1, 1776, one of the most influential groups was founded, by Adam Weishaupt and Illuminati. They were called the Bavarian Illuminati which started in Bavaria, Germany, most people think that the Illuminati is a bad thing but the reason Illuminati was formed was to promote equality and oppose of the Catholic Church's authority, they were dreaming of an adequate world. Adam Weishaupt (Founder Of the Illuminati) was a firm believer in equality and was looking for a way to get his agenda across the board to Bavaria then to the whole of Germany, so he started the Illuminati with the main goal of encouraging independence and equality for everyone, the Illuminati even believed women should be educated and treated as equals in a time that they weren't. They also thought the catholic church shouldn’t have the amount of power that it had and control people's lives. The secret society soon became massively popular in Bavaria by adopting by invading other popular groups like the Freemasons and persuading freemason members to join.

    The Illuminati's most prominent members were known to be some of the most influential people in Germany at that time, consisting of philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder (Famous German Philosopher), writers like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (Famous German Poet), soldiers, and politicians. Despite the group seeking incredibly lofty goals and achieving over 2,500 members in the state of Bavaria, Germany, they didn’t get the total influence they wanted and the Illuminati shut down in 1784. They didn’t shut down with the intention of giving up, they had shut down after the murmurings about the secret society's goals came out and the government began keeping tabs on the Illuminati and its members, soon after the government obtained sacred Illuminati data that contained anti-government/catholic church ideas. Immediately Royal Charles Theodore, (Elector of Bavaria), enacted the secret society veto, this law banned all secret societies in Germany including the Illuminati. The government began hunting for members. Adam Weishaupt was banished from Bavaria, Homes got searched, documents were seized, and members were arrested, and that was the known end of the Illuminati to everyone.

        Today there are many conspiracy theories surrounding the group about what they might control today this started in 1975 when dell publishing hired two authors Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson to write a book. The two authors decided they should write a novel and discuss conspiracy theories in the book and named it Illuminatus. They thought it would be a great story to spread misinformation about the Illuminati about what they have done and control. The book ended up spreading lots of theories and fake news that sparked interest in some of the conspiracies of the time like who shot John F Kennedy. Although the Illuminati was technically shut down five hundred years ago Musical artists Jay-Z and Beyoncé have teased the Illuminati's existence by raising their hands into the Illuminati signature triangle at concerts suggesting that they may have involvement in the group.

      Although there are many claims about who is in the Illuminati and what they control in today's modern society. there is currently no actual proof of any groups having ties to the original Bavarian Illuminati in over 500 years.
